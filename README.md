# Scala for the Impatient

Here are my answers to the questions in the book [Scala for the Impatient](http://horstmann.com/scala/)

The answers are in specs, using ScalaTest, FreeSpec with ShouldMatchers.

Writing/Running these in [IntelliJ Community Edition Version 12](http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/free_java_ide.html)
with the [Scala Plugin](http://blog.jetbrains.com/scala/)

This combination is awesome because it lets you run a single spec at a time, which I've not
been able to do with other combinations of test suites and IntelliJ. Not saying other combinations
can't do that, I just couldn't make it work.
